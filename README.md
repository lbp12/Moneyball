# Moneyball

## Overview
In this project we have gathered baseball player statistics from the built in python library, pybaseball, to utilize in training a supervised machine learning model in order to predict if a player will be made MVP.<br>
- Selected Topic --- Baseball
- Reason of selecting topic --- There is a vast amount of statistical data in baseball and we believe this will help in creating a well trained prediction model.
- Description of source data --- Our data was gathered from a built in python library, pybaseball. This library was developed by James LeDoux, a data scientist and armchair sabermetrician.
- Question to answer --- Can we predict an MVP based on a player's batting statistics?<br>

## Project Outline

### Technologies to be Used
Language: Python, SQL (TBD)

Interpreter: Jupyter Notebook

Packages: from pybaseball import batting_stats_range
          from sklearn import (TBD)

Libraries: import pandas as pd           

Database: either PostgreSQL or AWS (TBD)

Machine Learning Model: TBD

### Machine Learning Model
- Which model did you choose and why?
- How are you training your model?
- What is the model's accuracy?
- How does this model work?
